Our team's first ever game... dont be too brutal... 
Added all of the "src" folder and the required files to run the program, Save file needs to be OUT of the src directory, one level behind it. its open source so feel free to download the code and mess around with it and 
of course if you have any improvements or recommendations for us we will more than love to hear your comments.
